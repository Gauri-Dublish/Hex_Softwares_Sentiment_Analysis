# Sentiment Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive implementation for sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading datasets, cleaning, and preparing the text data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Applying techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings to extract meaningful features.
3. **Model Training**: Training multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks) to classify text data.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**: Generating visualizations (e.g., word clouds, confusion matrices) to interpret results.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Open the Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis_file1.ipynb
   ```
5. **Run All Cells**: Execute the cells in sequence to reproduce the analysis.
